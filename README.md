hujsconf-redirect
=================

A simple node.js redirect app to deal with URL proliferation that we can't handle via DNS/etc.

To deploy: ```af update hujsconf```
To run locally: ```npm install; node app.js```, then point to http://localhost:3000, which should redirect immediately to http://www.hujs.org
